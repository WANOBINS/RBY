This game is being developed for Global Game jam 2017 http://globalgamejam.org/ with the theme of "Waves" (Note the commit date/time, Walek, I waited until after Hawaii Jams started :innocent: )

For our purposes we plan to focus on light waves creating different colors.

I may update this Readme with further info as we get further into development.
