This game is being developed for Global Game jam 2017 http://globalgamejam.org/ with the theme of "Waves" (Note: I waited until after Hawaii Jams started :innocent: )

For our purposes we plan to focus on light waves creating different colors.

Well it didn't quite turn out the way we were hoping, but we got a working game involving colors and being able to pass through colored "glass" walls that match your color.
